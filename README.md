# Universal iCal

Oftentimes, companies have Oauth policies rendering you unable to sign up for calendar apps which is the part of the huge appeal behind Tidbyt. This software uses the universal iCalendar (.ics files) to render the day's meetings.


**Known Limitations**

Microsoft uses a different timezone format than Unix based machines. Currently, only TimeZones from American Microsoft Exchange calendars are recognized. Feel free to PR more Microsoft time zones here: https://github.com/quesurifn/ics-calendar-tidbyt-lambda.git
